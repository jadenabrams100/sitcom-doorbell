# sitcom-doorbell

A WIP for a doorbell that plays a sitcom bumper music clip whenever the door is open. This is the proof of concept code written for use with a Raspberry Pi. This is some of the first Python code I had ever written so excuse the crudeness. In the future, I want to use a different board, such as an ESP32, which should hopefully give me loadtime and power usage improvements.

##TODO List:
* Get an ESP32
* Write code for ESP32 that mimics python code
* Devise way to reduce potential memory usage/optimize code
