# sitcom-doorbell

A WIP for a doorbell that plays a sitcom bumper music clip whenever the door is open. This is the proof of concept code written for use with a Raspberry Pi. In the future, I want to use a different board, such as an ASP32, that will let run code by itself instead of having to wait for an OS to boot up.
